# Project Proposal: Sending Money Web Application

**Professor:** Nilay  
**Student:** Andrea Polito  , Avi Patel

## Introduction / Proposal

Our aim is to develop a web application using Flask API and HTML code that facilitates money transactions between users. The web page will enable users to input sender and receiver details to initiate money transfers. Each user will have an initial balance, which they can utilize for sending money.

## Considerations

### Fillable Fields
- Recipient Email
- Recipient Name
- Sender Name
- Sender Email

### Receipt Form
Implement a receipt form that confirms successful money transfers based on the intended recipient.
Ensure the transferred amount is within the sender's initial balance.

## Additional Functionality

### Database Integration
- Store user details and simple transaction logs in table/database.
- Maintain a transaction history to track all money transfers made through the application.

### Error Handling
- Develop error handling mechanisms to address any issues encountered during money transfers.
- Provide informative error messages to guide users through the resolution process.

## Conclusion

The proposed web application aims to streamline money transfers between users while prioritizing security, usability, and reliability. By making use of Flask API and HTML template for user interface as well as SQLite for database integration, we intend to create a robust platform for safe and efficient money transactions.
